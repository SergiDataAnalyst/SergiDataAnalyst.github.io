# [Project 1: Overlaying glottis images and accessing their metadata for a better diagnosis](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
A quick medical diagnosis can help save lives! Once a patient seeks health care, there is an iterative process of information gathering, information integration and interpretation, and determining a working diagnosis. Performing a clinical history and interview, conducting a physical exam, performing diagnostic testing, and referring or consulting with other clinicians are all ways of accumulating information that may be relevant to understanding a patient's health problem. The information-gathering approaches can be employed at different times, and diagnostic information can be obtained in different orders. The continuous process of information gathering, integration, and interpretation involves hypothesis generation and updating prior probabilities as more information is learned. 
Of major importance in the diagnostic process is the element of time. Most diseases evolve over time, and there can be a delay between the onset of disease and the onset of a patient's symptoms; time can also elapse before a patient's symptoms are recognized as a specific diagnosis. Sometimes, image diagnosis can become a rather long wait, this can be caused by a bottleneck in the health care system. Machine Learning algorithms can help speed up this process and potentially save lifes.
* Created a tool that imports and opens images and accesses their metadata files
* Overlaying of images and their segmented masks for a better first view
* Labeling the result overlayed images with information stored in their metadata file
* Analyzing data from segmented mask images
* Developing a `Machile Learning` algorithm to examine and determine the diagnosis of a patient (pending)
* Training dataset of images (pending)

# [Project 2: Scrapping Reddit data with a bot to analyze the impact of keywords on post engagement](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this project I built a bot to browse and extract data from any subreddit. The bot can access data from subreddit posts labeled as `New`, `Trending` or `Top`. The useful information gathered for each post is, the complete title, number of upvotes, number of comments and the date and time. This project aims to showcase the importance of choosing keywords or emojis to give a better engagement. The reason behind choosing Reddit is because during the past years it has become a relevant source for statistical information collection for surveys since it offers a notorious widespread representation of nowadays society spectrum of opinion.

* Used the Python Reddit API Wrapper tool to generate a scrapping data bot
* Data gathering from desired subreddit(s) into `.csv` files stored locally to later import them as a DataFrame
* Cleaning the data stored in the DataFrame containing thousands of posts information
* Organizing and classifying the DataFrame
* Creating dictionaries with the most relevant keywords and emojis
* Analyzing the impact of keywords

# [Project 3: Will it snow in Munich on Christmas Eve? ](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 

As in many other scientific fields, the proliferation of tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning holds great promise for weather prediction. We have seen some of what’s possible in our research on applying machine learning to forecasts of high-impact weather. These tools open up new possibilities for better forecasts.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning can help with some of these challenges. Forecasters are using these tools in several ways now, including making predictions of high-impact weather that the models can’t provide.
