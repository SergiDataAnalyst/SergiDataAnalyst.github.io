# [Project 1: Overlaying glottis images and accessing their metadata for a better diagnosis](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Created a tool that imports and opens images and accesses their metadata files
* Overlaying of images and their segmented masks for a better first view
* Labeling the result overlayed images with information stored in their metadata file
* Analyzing data from segmented mask images
* Developing a `Machile Learning` algorithm to examine and determine the diagnosis of a patient (pending)
* Training dataset of images (pending)

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
